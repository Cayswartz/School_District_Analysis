# School District Analysis with Python

## Overview of the School District Analysis
We are helping City School District analyze information on standardized testing results for both math and reading across a handful of schools and grade levels. These insights will be used to make strategic decisions at the schools and district level. We will be anazlyzing not only the test scores but also the funding per school to help make decisions on school funding and budget. 


## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
Overall, we saw fairly minor changes at the district level onces we removed the math and reading scores from Thomas High School for 9th graders from the data. Overall, we saw the average math scores jump from 79 to 78.9 and we saw the percentage of passing math move from 75% to 74.8%. For reading, the average score started at 81.9 and stayed teh same after the cleaning of the data and the percentage passign went from 85.8% to 85.7%. Overall passign saw the largest change, moving from 65.2% to 64.9%.

### How is the school summary affected?
When looking at the school summary report the changes were more noticeable because Thomas High School was seperated out from the other high schools. We saw the largest change in the percentage of students that passed the class moving from 97% and 93% for reading and math, respectively, to 69% and 66%. When not accounting for the 9th grade scores we actually saw the averages scores stay around the same with math going from 83.41 to 82.35 and reading going from 83.84 to 83.89


### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Prior to making the replacements Thomas High School was one of the top performing schools with falling in the 90% range for both math and reading. After the adjustment was made we saw Thoma High School fall closer to the bottom with math and reading both falling in the 60% passing range.


### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
#### Math and reading scores by grade
The replacement of the ninth-grade scores did not have any affect on 10th, 11th or 12th grade. The only change that was seen was Thomas High School now has Nan for both math and reading scores for 9th grade.

#### Scores by school spending
Thomas High School feel in the $631-645 spending range however no changes were seen to this spending range in the formatted table. However, when taking a closer look at the unformatted table, you are able to see a slight difference between the before and after data.

#### Scores by school size
Thomas High School is a medium school so minor changes were seen in the segment. Similar to above, when looking at the formatted data no changes are noticeable but when looking at the unformatted changes there was a slight change.

#### Scores by school type
Similar to the three above, there was very little change here.

## Summary
Overall, there was not much change seen between the altered numbers however I still believe it is important to make updates like these because you never know what change an inaccuracy like this could make on the higher level data.
